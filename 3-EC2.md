- EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
- EC2 = **Elastic Compute Cloud** = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
    - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
    - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
    - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works


### EC2 sizing & configuration options

- Operating System (OS): **Linux, Windows or Mac OS**
- How much compute power & cores **(CPU)**
- How much random-access memory **(RAM)**
- How much storage space:
    - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
    - hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
    - Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: **security group**
- **Bootstrap script** (configure at first launch): **EC2 User Data**

### EC2 User Data

- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an **EC2 User data** script.
- **bootstrapping** means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only **run once** at the instance **first start**
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
    - Installing updates
    - Installing software
    - Downloading common files from the internet
    - Anything you can think of
- **The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user**

### Hands-On:
  
- Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
- We’ll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console
- We’ll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters
- We’ll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
- We’ll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

Steps:
- **Create Instance:**

- **Name of the instance and other tags values(optional):**

- **Network Setting - allow http connections from anywhere to see a html by webserver**

- **Storage Volumes - select Delete on termination from advance settings (only for tutorial purpose)**

- **user-data:**
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  # user data
  # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
  yum update -y
  yum install -y httpd
  systemctl start httpd
  systemctl enable httpd
  echo "<h1>Hello Shreenath from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
  ```
  
  **Note: User data script only runs on a first startup.
  If we need this script to run on every restart
  we need to use below script:**
  
  ```
  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="//"
  MIME-Version: 1.0

  --//
  Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset="us-ascii"
  MIME-Version: 1.0

  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cloud-config.txt"

  #cloud-config
  cloud_final_modules:
    - [scripts-user, always]

  --//

  #!/bin/bash

  yum update -y
  yum install -y httpd
  systemctl start httpd
  systemctl enable httpd
  echo "<h1>Hello Shreenath from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
  --//--
  ```

### EC2 Instance Types - Overview

- You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

- AWS has the following naming convention:
  
  - **m5.2xlarge**
    - m: instance class
    - 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
    - 2xlarge: size within the instance class

  #### EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
 
  - Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/224661864-e6d6b8cf-f299-43e8-9a9e-489f0b24e3e7.png)

  - Balance between:
    - Compute
    - Memory
    - Networking
  - Wwe will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 instance

  #### EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized

  - Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
    - Batch processing workloads
    - Media transcoding
    - High performance web serversHigh performance computing (HPC)
    - Scientific modeling & machine learning
    - Dedicated gaming servers

  #### EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized
  
  - Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
  - Use cases:
        - High performance, relational/non-relational databases
        - Distributed web scale cache stores
        - In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
        - Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

  #### EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized

  - Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
  - Use cases:
        - High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
        - Relational & NoSQL databases
        - Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
        - Data warehousing applications
        - Distributed file systems

### Introduction to Security Groups

- Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.

- Security groups only contain **allow** rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

  #### Security Groups Deeper Dive
  - Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
  - They regulate:
      - Access to Ports
      - Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
      - Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
      - Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

  #### Security Groups Diagram

  #### Security Groups Good to know
  
  - Can be attached to multiple instances
  - Locked down to a region / VPC combination
  - Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
  - It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
  - If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
  - If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched
  - All inbound traffic is blocked by default
  - All outbound traffic is authorised by default

  #### Referencing other security groups Diagram

  #### Classic Ports to know
  
  - 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
  - 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
  - 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
  - 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
  - 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
  - 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

  #### SSH Summary Table
  
  |               | SSH                | Putty              | EC2 Instance Connect |
  |---------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
  | Mac           | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  | Linux         | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  | Windows < 10  |                    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  | Windows >= 10 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  
  #### IAM Roles to EC2 Instance
  
  when using EC2 Instance and want to use aws cli on it, we should never configure aws cli with our api key. because other users from our account, can access this Instance and can fetch api id and secret key.

  Instead we should attach IAM Role to the instance.
