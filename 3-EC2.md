## EC2       

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/224479630-3666e517-cb01-41ae-9ff1-32bfb419db0c.png)


- EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
- EC2 = **Elastic Compute Cloud** = Infrastructure as a Service
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
    - Renting virtual machines (EC2)
    - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
    - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
    - Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works


### EC2 sizing & configuration options

- Operating System (OS): **Linux, Windows or Mac OS**
- How much compute power & cores **(CPU)**
- How much random-access memory **(RAM)**
- How much storage space:
    - Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
    - hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
    - Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: **security group**
- **Bootstrap script** (configure at first launch): **EC2 User Data**

### EC2 User Data

- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an **EC2 User data** script.
- **bootstrapping** means launching commands when a machine starts
- That script is only **run once** at the instance **first start**
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
    - Installing updates
    - Installing software
    - Downloading common files from the internet
    - Anything you can think of
- **The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user**

### Hands-On:
  
- Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
- We’ll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console
- We’ll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters
- We’ll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
- We’ll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

Steps:
- **Create Instance:**

- **user-data:**
  ```
  #!/bin/bash
  # user data
  # install httpd (Linux 2 version)
  yum update -y
  yum install -y httpd
  systemctl start httpd
  systemctl enable httpd
  echo "<h1>Hello Shreenath from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
  ```
  
  **Note: User data script only runs on a first startup.
  If we need this script to run on every restart
  we need to use below script:**
  
  ```
  Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="//"
  MIME-Version: 1.0

  --//
  Content-Type: text/cloud-config; charset="us-ascii"
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
  Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="cloud-config.txt"

  #cloud-config
  cloud_final_modules:
    - [scripts-user, always]

  --//
  Content-Type: text/x-shellscript; charset="us-ascii"

  yum update -y
  yum install -y httpd
  systemctl start httpd
  systemctl enable httpd
  echo "<h1>Hello Shreenath from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
  --//--
  ```

### EC2 Instance Types - Overview

- You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/224661179-f137e0b7-02c3-43f4-a1a2-8450217426f9.png)

- AWS has the following naming convention:
  
  - **m5.2xlarge**
    - m: instance class
    - 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
    - 2xlarge: size within the instance class

  #### EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
 
  - Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/224661864-e6d6b8cf-f299-43e8-9a9e-489f0b24e3e7.png)

  - Balance between:
    - Compute
    - Memory
    - Networking
  - Wwe will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 instance

  #### EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized

  - Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors:
    - Batch processing workloads
    - Media transcoding
    - High performance web serversHigh performance computing (HPC)

### Introduction to Security Groups

- Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
- They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/224663795-8c5e0f12-a9c8-47f7-8700-b24f6092977b.png)

- Security groups only contain **allow** rules
- Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

  #### Security Groups Deeper Dive
  - Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
  - They regulate:
      - Access to Ports
      - Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
      - Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
      - Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

  #### Security Groups Diagram

  #### Security Groups Good to know
  
  - Can be attached to multiple instances
  - Locked down to a region / VPC combination
  - Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
  - It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
  - If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
  - If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application error or it’s not launched
  - All inbound traffic is blocked by default
  - All outbound traffic is authorised by default

  #### Referencing other security groups Diagram

  #### Classic Ports to know
  
  - 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
  - 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
  - 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
  - 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
  - 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
  - 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

  #### SSH Summary Table
  
  |               | SSH                | Putty              | EC2 Instance Connect |
  |---------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
  | Mac           | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  | Linux         | :heavy_check_mark: |                    | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  | Windows < 10  |                    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  | Windows >= 10 | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   |
  
  #### IAM Roles to EC2 Instance
  
  when using EC2 Instance and want to use aws cli on it, we should never configure aws cli with our api key. because other users from our account, can access this Instance and can fetch api id and secret key. 
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/225854995-ca0f6740-6bf7-4b8d-beb8-1f093bb67b6e.png)

  Instead we should attach IAM Role to the instance.

 ### EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
 
 - **On-Demand Instances** – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
 - **Reserved (1 & 3 years)**
        - Reserved Instances – long workloads
        - Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
 - **Savings Plans (1 & 3 years)** –commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
 - **Spot Instances** – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
 - **Dedicated Hosts** – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
 - **Dedicated Instances** – no other customers will share your hardware
 - **Capacity Reservations** – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

#### EC2 On Demand

- Pay for what you use:
        - Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
        - All other operating systems - billing per hour
- Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
- No long-term commitment
- Recommended for **short-term and un-interrupted workloads**, where you can't predict how the application will behave

#### EC2 Reserved Instances

- Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
- You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
- **Reservation Period** – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
- **Payment Options** – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
- **Reserved Instance’s Scope** – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
- Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
- You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
- **Convertible Reserved Instance**
    - Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
    - Up to 66% discount
- **Note: the % discounts are different from the video as AWS change them over time – the exact numbers are not needed for the exam. This is just for illustrative purposes**

#### EC2 Savings Plans

- Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
- Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
- Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
- Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
- Flexible across:
    - Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
    - OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
    - Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

#### EC2 Spot Instances

- Can get a **discount of up to 90%** compared to On-demand
- Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
- The **MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS**
- **Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure**
    - Batch jobs
    - Data analysis
    - Image processing
    - Any **distributed** workloads
    - Workloads with a flexible start and end time
- **Not suitable for critical jobs or databases**

#### EC2 Dedicated Hosts

- A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
- Allows you address **compliance requirements** and **use your existing server- bound software licenses** (per-socket, per-core, pe—VM software licenses)
- Purchasing Options:
    - **On-demand** – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
    - **Reserved** - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
- The most expensive option
- Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your Own License)
- Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

#### EC2 Dedicated Instances 

- Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you
- May share hardware with other instances in same account
- No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

#### EC2 Capacity Reservations

- Reserve **On-Demand** instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
- You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
- **No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts**
- Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts
- You’re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
- Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

#### Which purchasing option is right for me?

**Resort Exmple**

- **On demand:** coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
- **Reserved:** like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
- **Savings Plans:** pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View, …)
- **Spot instances:** the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
- **Dedicated Hosts:** We book an entire building of the resort
- **Capacity Reservations:** you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it

#### Price Comparison Example – m4.large – us-east-1

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/225879128-55078b87-2ae5-4d93-8a8d-04a250897135.png)

#### EC2 Spot Instance Requests

- Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
- Define **max spot price** and get the instance while **current spot price < max**
    - The hourly spot price varies based on offer and capacity
    - If the current spot price > your max price you can choose to **stop** or **terminate** your instance with a 2 minutes grace period.
- Other strategy: **Spot Block** (AWS Removed this from 2021)
    - “block” spot instance during a specified time frame (1 to 6 hours) without interruptions
    - In rare situations, the instance may be reclaimed
- **Used for batch jobs, data analysis, or workloads that are resilient to failures.**
- **Not great for critical jobs or databases**
- https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=ap-south-1#SpotInstances:

#### How to terminate Spot Instances?

**You can only cancel Spot Instance requests that are open, active, or disabled. Cancelling a Spot Request does not terminate instances You must first cancel a Spot Request, and then terminate the associated Spot Instances**

#### Spot Fleets

- Spot Fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
- The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
    - Define possible launch pools: instance type (m5.large), OS, Availability Zone
    - Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose
    - Spot Fleet stops launching instances when reaching capacity or max cost
- Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
    - **lowestPrice:** from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workload)
    - **diversified:** distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
    - **capacityOptimized:** pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances
- **Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price**


### EC2 Section – Summary
