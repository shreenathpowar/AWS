## IAM

### IAM: Users & Groups

Users and Groups are created so that users can run specific services only not all which can cause cost.
Also provides security.

- IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
- Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared - Root is a God Mode in AWS.
- Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- Groups only contain users, not other groups
- Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

### IAM: Permissions
  
- Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
- These policies define the permissions of the users.
- In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs.
- e.g.

### IAM Policies:

IAM Policies are used to give permission to Users/Groups.

 #### IAM Policies Structure
 
 - **Consists of**
   - **Version:** policy language version, always include “2012-10-17”
   - **Id:** an identifier for the policy (optional)
   - **Statement:** one or more individual statements (required)
 - **Statements consists of**
   - **Sid:** an identifier for the statement (optional)
   - **Effect:** whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow, Deny)
   - **Principal:** account/user/role to which this policy applied to
   - **Action:** list of actions this policy allows or denies
   - **Resource:** list of resources to which the actions applied to
   - **Condition:** conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

  #### IAM – Password Policy

  Strong passwords = higher security for your account
  - In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
    - Set a minimum password length
    - Require specific character types:
      - including uppercase letters
      - lowercase letters
      - numbers
      - non-alphanumeric characters
    - Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
    - Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
    - Prevent password re-use

  #### Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
  
  - Users have access to your account and can possibly change configurations or delete resources in your AWS account
  - You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
  - MFA = password you know + security device you own

  - Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised
 
  #### MFA devices options in AWS
  
  1. **Virtual MFA Device** - Support for multiple tokens on a single device.

  2. **Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key** - Support for multiple root and IAM users using a single security key

  3. **Hardware Key Fob MFA Device**

### How can users access AWS ?

- To access AWS, you have three options:
  - AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
  - AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): protected by access keys
  - AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - for code: protected by access keys
- Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
- Users manage their own access keys
- Access Keys are secret, just like a password. Don’t share them
- Access Key ID ~= username
- Secret Access Key ~= password

  #### Example (Fake) Access Keys
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/224468974-84771a83-b61f-44cb-b9f6-ac5d710945bf.png)
  
  - Access key ID: AKIASK4E37PV4983d6C
  - Secret Access Key: AZPN3zojWozWCndIjhB0Unh8239a1bzbzO5fqqkZq
  - Remember: don’t share your access keys

  #### What’s the AWS CLI?
  
  - A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell
  - Direct access to the public APIs of AWS services
  - You can develop scripts to manage your resources
  - It’s open-source [(https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  - Alternative to using AWS Management Console

    ##### AWS CLI
    
    1. **create access key for command line interface.**
    2. **configure aws-cli**

      C:\Users\shreenath>aws configure
      AWS Access Key ID [None]: <Access Key ID>
      AWS Secret Access Key [None]: <Secret Access Key>
      Default region name [None]: ap-south-1
      Default output format [None]:

    3. **get IAM users list.**

      C:\Users\shreenath>aws iam list-users
      {
          "Users": [
              {
                  "Path": "/",
                  "UserName": "shreenath",
                  "UserId": "<User ID>",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::<Account ID>:user/shreenath",
                  "CreateDate": "2023-03-08T16:01:48+00:00",
                  "PasswordLastUsed": "2023-03-11T06:53:57+00:00"
              }
          ]
       }
       
     4. **In case of no permission for list-users operation**
     ```
     C:\Users\shreenath>aws iam list-users

     An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListUsers operation: User: arn:aws:iam::<Account ID>:user/shreenath is not authorized to perform: iam:ListUsers      on resource: arn:aws:iam::<Account ID>:user/ because no identity-based policy allows the iam:ListUsers action
     ```
     
     ##### AWS CloudShell
     
     AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that gives you command-line access to your AWS resources in the selected AWS region. AWS CloudShell comes pre-installed with popular tools for resource management and creation.
     You have the same credentials as you used to log in to the console.
     
     available regions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cloudshell.html

  #### What’s the AWS SDK?
  
  - AWS Software Development Kit (AWS SDK)
  - Language-specific APIs (set of libraries)
  - Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically
  - Embedded within your application
  - Supports
    - SDKs (JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++)
    - Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS, …)
    - IoT Device SDKs (Embedded C, Arduino, …)
  - Example: AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for Python

### IAM Roles for Services

- Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
- To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
- Common roles: 
  - EC2 Instance Roles
  - Lambda Function Roles
  - Roles for CloudFormation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73632896/224472792-72493906-f6bc-4e03-88b5-2270dff2fcc2.png)

### IAM Security Tools

**IAM Credentials Report (account-level)**
- a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials

**IAM Access Advisor (user-level)**
- Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
- You can use this information to revise your policies.

### IAM Guidelines & Best Practices

- Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
- One physical user = One AWS user
- Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
- Create a strong password policy
- Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
- Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
- Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report
- Never share IAM users & Access Keys

### IAM Summary 

- Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
- Groups: contains users only
- Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
- Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
- Security: MFA + Password Policy
- Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK
- Audit: IAM Credential Reports & IAM Access Advisor
